                    <h5 class="river-titles">The River Taren</h5>
                    <p>The river begins at the roots of the Mountains 
                        of Mist where it is fed by upstream 
                        tributaries. As it proceeds east the flow 
                        widens and descends steeply eventually passing 
                        dramatically over a cliff and creating the 
                        spectacular waterfall known as Eldrene's Veil. 
                        From there the river continues to widen and 
                        after several miles passes the town of Taren 
                        Ferry on its southern riverbank. The river 
                        continues east before changing course to the 
                        southeast where it passes the Waterwood and 
                        The Mire. Eventually the waterflow merges with 
                        the larger River Manetherendrelle, which is 
                        known locally as the White River. Photo by Pixbay</p>

                    <h5 class="river-titles">The White River</h5>
                    <p>The White River or Manetherendrelle is one of 
                        the primary waterways of the Westlands. 
                        Together with its major tributary, the 
                        Arinelle, this river dominates much of the 
                        central-western region of the continent and 
                        keeps those lands fertile.
                        The Manetherendrelle itself rises in the 
                        Mountains of Mist at the extreme 
                        south-western tip of the Two Rivers district 
                        of Andor. Its initial course along the 
                        southern border of the Two Rivers is marked 
                        by rapids, which causes the water to foam and 
                        gives the river its local name of the White 
                        River. The White River is the southernmost of 
                        the waterflows that flanks the Two Rivers 
                        region.[1] Although it has no crossing during 
                        modern times, the Forest of Shadows on the 
                        opposite far bank was also part of Manetheren 
                        must have been reachable by some means. 
                        In fact, a road extends south beyond Deven 
                        Ride that seems to end nowhere, but may have 
                        once led to a bridge. Photo by Pixbay

                    <h5 class="river-titles">The Winespring Water</h5>
                    <p>The river is fed by an underground aquifer 
                        which is, in turn, a product of drainage 
                        from the Mountains of Mist. The headwater, 
                        called the Winespring, is located near the 
                        west end of the village Green and gushes 
                        forth with enough force to knock down a 
                        grown man. From the Green, the stream passes
                         beneath two low railed footbridges, 
                         the Wagon Bridge, and then flows adjacent 
                         to the Winespring Inn. From there it widens 
                         rapidly and willow trees begin to dot its 
                         banks as it continues east past the mill 
                         owned by Jon Thane. After several more 
                         miles it splits into dozens of flows in 
                         the Waterwood before draining into 
                         The Mire. Photo by Snow White</p>
