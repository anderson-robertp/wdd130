    <p>Hello world! As above, my name is Robert and I am from Louisiana.
        I have been an IT professional for about 15 years now. I am studying
        software development because I am looking to finish a degree I started years ago.
        I am excited to learn web development because everyone asks if I can do websites,
        but the answer has been no.  I haven't had a need to. I am looking to expand my skillset
        to make myself more marketable.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am married to a wonderful woman named Mary, and I have 4 children; 2 boys and 2 girls.  They are simply the best. One of our
        favorite things to do as a family is to play board games. My hobby is Dungeons and Dragons. I have been slowly
        introducing it to my family, both close and extended.  The longest game I have had going is the 
        one that began during the pandemic.  We started it as a way to keep close to each other
        and we included extended family as time went on.
        </p>

            I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints all my life.
            I went on my mission to the Calgary, Alberta, Canada mission from 2004 to 2006.

        I really enjoyed Presiden Nelson's talk about being peacemakers from the last conference.
        I feel that is something I could work on more.

        "Civility and decency seem to have disappeared during this era of polarization and passionate disagreements.

        Vulgarity, faultfinding, and evil speaking of others are all too common. Too many pundits, politicians, entertainers, and other influencers throw insults constantly. I am greatly concerned that so many people seem to believe that it is completely acceptable to condemn, malign, and vilify anyone who does not agree with them. Many seem eager to damage another’s reputation with pathetic and pithy barbs!

        Anger never persuades. Hostility builds no one. Contention never leads to inspired solutions. Regrettably, we sometimes see contentious behavior even within our own ranks. We hear of those who belittle their spouses and children, of those who use angry outbursts to control others, and of those who punish family members with the “silent treatment.” We hear of youth and children who bully and of employees who defame their colleagues.
        </p>
        My dear brothers and sisters, this should not be. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are to be examples of how to interact with others—especially when we have differences of opinion. One of the easiest ways to identify a true follower of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people."
