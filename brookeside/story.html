        <h3>History of the Brookeside Exploration Society</h3>
        <p>
            The Brookside Exploration Society was established with the primary objective of venturing into unexplored territories, 
            offering its members the opportunity to discover new places and embrace the thrill of exploration. The society was founded 
            by the renowned explorer Renault de Wathes, who, after concluding a remarkable and illustrious career, sought to maintain 
            the spirit of adventure that had fueled his life's work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Renault, recognizing the insatiable desire for travel and discovery that resides within many individuals, created the 
            society as a means to provide an outlet for their wanderlust. The society became a sanctuary for those who yearned for 
            new experiences, whether they were seeking an antidote to their craving for exploration or a secure and organized way 
            to satisfy their innate desire to travel.

        <h3>Attack on Greenest</h3>
            <p>
                A group consisting of Thoamsina, Grim, Kath'Dal, and Doyle was exploring 
                around the town of Greenest when a blue dragon attacked.  After fighting their way to safety, 
                the group was asked to help the townsfolk also find safety. For hours the group battled the strange invaders until they left.

        <h3>The Cult of the Dragon</h3>
                <p>
                    At the behest of the mayor of Greenest, the group was tasked with retrieving a member of the Harpers guild.
                    Although with differing motives but having found a common foe in the invaders, 
                    the group went on to a local cave system to find the Harper agent. They discovered that the 
                    cave served as the camp for what they found to be the Cult of the Dragon.  
                    There they found evidence of a plan for some sort of massive undertaking involving the theft of massive amounts of treasure.

        <h3>Wagon train</h3>
                <p>
                    Armed with this information, the group shadowed the caravan that left the camp 
                    tying to discover more about thier plot. Along the way they met many allies, enemies, and everything in between.
                    After many months of travel, the final destination seemed to be a sinkng castle in the Mere of Dead Men.
                    Sympathizing with the plight of the lizard people who were being used as slave labor, the group took the castle from the
                    Cult. But where did the leaders go?

        <h3>Hunting Lodge</h3>
                <p>
                    After many days of investigation, the group found a teleportation circle. Upon activating the circle, they found themeselves
                    at a hunting lodge much further south than where the at the castle! In the hunting lodge, 
                    the found a former leader of the cult willing to make a deal. In exchange for information about the location of the stolen treasure, 
                    the group agreed to help the cultist return to her former position. After agreeing to the terms and recieving the informaion, 
                    Kath'Dal decided to finally get his revenge and attacked.

        <h3>SkyReach Castle</h3>
                <p>
                    Using the informaion provided by the now deceased former leader, the group made their way to castle floating in the clouds.
                    Their they managed to stop the Cult from moving the treasure to the ritual site. The Cult was trying to resurect Tiamat, 
                    the mother of all evil dragons. They had to get this informaion to the leaders at Waterdeep.

            <h3>Waterdeep and the Council</h3>
            <p>
                When the group arrived in Waterdeep they were summoned to the castle. There they told their story and provided the evidence they collected.
                The group was then empowered to act to stop the Cult and the resurrection of Tiamat. Their first objective wasto track down the Wyrmspeakers,
                leaders of the Cult of Dragons, and thier powerful Dragon Masks.
