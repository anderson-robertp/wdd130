      <h3>The Story so Far</h3>
      <p>
        The Brookeside Exploration Society was initially formed to explore places where its members have never been before. 
        Founded by famed explorer Renault de Wathes after he retired from his storied career, Renault used the society
        to keep spirit the adventure alive.
        Many members are simply looking for a cure for their wanderlust or a safe way to travel.  
      </p>
      <p>
        A group consisting of Thoamsina, Grim, Kath'Dal, and Doyle was exploring 
        around the town of Greenest when a blue dragon attacked.  After fighting their way to safety, 
        the group was asked to help the townsfolk also find safety. For hours the group battled the strange invaders until they left.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the behest of the mayor of Greenest, the group was tasked with retrieving a member of the Harpers guild.
        Although with differing motives but having found a common foe in the invaders, 
        the group went on to a local cave system to find the Harper agent. They discovered that the 
        cave served as the camp for what they found to be the Cult of the Dragon.  
        There they found evidence of a plan for some sort of massive undertaking involving the theft of massive amounts of treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Armed with this information, the group shadowed the caravan that left the camp 
        tying to discover more about thier plot. Along the way they met many allies, enemies, and everything in between.
        After many months of travel, the final destination seemed to be a sinkng castle in the Mere of Dead Men.
        Sympathizing with the plight of the lizard people who were being used as slave labor, the group took the castle from the
        Cult. But where did the leaders go?
      </p>
      <p>
        After many days of investigation, the group found a teleportation circle. Upon activating the circle, they found themeselves
        at a hunting lodge much further south than where the at the castle! In the hunting lodge, 
        the found a former leader of the cult willing to make a deal. In exchange for information about the location of the stolen treasure, 
        the group agreed to help the cultist return to her former position. After agreeing to the terms and recieving the informaion, 
        Kath'Dal decided to finally get his revenge and attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the informaion provided by the now deceased former leader, the group made their way to castle floating in the clouds.
        Their they managed to stop the Cult from moving the treasure to the ritual site. The Cult was trying to resurect Tiamat, 
        the mother of all evil dragons. They had to get this informaion to the leaders at Waterdeep.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the group arrived in Waterdeep they were summoned to the castle. There they told their story and provided the evidence they collected.
        The group was then empowered to act to stop the Cult and the resurrection of Tiamat. Their first objective wasto track down the Wyrmspeakers,
        leaders of the Cult of Dragons, and thier powerful Dragon Masks.

          Thomasina Riverhopper, a spirited and adventurous character, hails from the 
          frigid and rugged region of Icewind Dale. Growing up in such a harsh environment 
          shaped her into a resilient and resourceful individual. Thomasina was raised 
          in a family of pirates, surrounded by the tales of daring escapades on the high seas. 
          Fascinated by the allure of a life filled with freedom and excitement, she eagerly 
          joined her brothers on their pirating ventures.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she sailed alongside her brothers, Thomasina quickly developed a strong affinity 
          for the sea. Her natural talent for navigation and her sharp wit made her a 
          valuable asset to the crew. Despite her undeniable skills and contributions, 
          Thomasina found herself facing a disappointing hurdle within her own family. 
          Her brothers, hesitant to break away from traditional gender roles, refused to 
          promote her to a position where she could command her own ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determined to prove herself and seeking her own path, Thomasina made the 
          difficult decision to venture out on her own. Fuelled by a hunger for fortune 
          and adventure, she embarked on a personal quest to carve her own destiny. 
          With her heart set on experiencing the vast wonders the world had to offer, 
          Thomasina left her familiar surroundings behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, not all journeys are smooth sailing. Thomasina soon found herself 
          wanted in the city of Neverwinter, likely due to her pirating activities. 
          Aware of the risks and the need to keep a low profile, she sought a means 
          to travel incognito. Thomasina joined the Brookeside Exploration Society to escape
          from her dangerous past. Little did she know that danger is never far from her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kath'dal, a survivor of a cruel and tumultuous upbringing, was born in the shadow 
          of the imposing Sunset Mountains. His mother, a human servant to a high-ranking member 
          of the nefarious Cult of the Dragon known as the "Wearer of the Purple," brought him 
          into a world fraught with hardship and prejudice. Kath'dal's very existence was marked 
          by his infernal lineage, making his life even more challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up as the son of a servant, Kath'dal experienced a harsh and unforgiving existence. 
          His mother, seemingly indifferent to his well-being, showed no signs of motherly love, 
          leading others to suspect that he was the result of a "forced encounter." The cult members 
          took every opportunity to belittle him, subjecting him to constant ridicule and derogatory 
          names such as "dirty infernal." As a cruel reminder of his supposed impurity, they regularly 
          doused him with buckets of water, aiming to "wash away the filth."
        </p> 
        <p>
          Amidst the torment, Kath'dal's life took an unexpected turn when he formed an unlikely bond 
          with Elenia, the daughter of the influential Dragonclaw. Over three years, their secret 
          friendship blossomed into the possibility of romance. However, their happiness was short-lived 
          when a Keeper of the Secret Horde accidentally discovered their relationship. Enraged by the 
          perceived impropriety, the Keeper unleashed a horde of skeletons upon the Dragonclaw and his 
          followers, resulting in a bloodbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Desperate to escape the chaos, Kath'dal and Elenia made a daring attempt to flee together 
          by plunging into the treacherous Chianthor River. The unforgiving current proved too formidable, 
          and Kath'dal awoke to the devastating sight of Elenia's lifeless body. Yet, amidst the sorrow, a 
          figure stood before him—his own father, a High Devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          The High Devil, recognizing his son's pain and thirst for revenge, made a sinister offer. In exchange 
          for Kath'dal's servitude and the condemnation of the cultists' souls to the Nine Hells for eternal 
          torment, he promised unimaginable power and the means to exact vengeance upon the Cult of the Dragon. 
          Witnessing the dark magics wielded by the cultists and driven by his burning desire for retribution, 
          Kath'dal found himself unable to resist the allure of such power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accepting his father as his patron, Kath'dal became a Warlock, granted otherworldly abilities 
          to carry out his quest for revenge. However, his father placed a binding stipulation upon him—
          a truth that would haunt Kath'dal for eternity. The inability to lie became his curse, 
          as speaking an untruth would subject him to agonizing infernal fire, leaving him in debilitating torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his newfound powers and his wit and charm as his weapons, Kath'dal is determined 
          to foil his enemies and bring about the downfall of the Cult of the Dragon. In his interactions, 
          he carefully avoids making statements that are overtly untruthful, instead relying on clever 
          wordplay and deception to navigate treacherous situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the sprawling metropolis of a large city, Grim and his younger brother, Sasashi, 
          found themselves trapped in the unforgiving grip of poverty. Born into the slums, 
          their lives were characterized by struggle and hardship from an early age. With 
          limited opportunities and a desperate need to survive, they were forced to find 
          unconventional means to earn even the most meager sustenance.
        </p>
          In their quest for survival, the brothers stumbled upon a gladiator arena. The 
          raucous cheers and the promise of a reward for victory enticed them, offering 
          a glimmer of hope amidst the gloom of their circumstances. Recognizing the 
          potential for earning enough money to secure their basic needs, Grim and Sasashi 
          made the daring decision to step into the arena and embrace the life of gladiators.
        <p>
          As they immersed themselves in this brutal and unforgiving world, Grim became 
          the embodiment of strength and resilience. Towering over his opponents, he possessed 
          an imposing physique that struck fear into the hearts of those who faced him. His raw
          power and unyielding determination made him a formidable force within the gladiatorial circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Grim's true strength lay not only in his physical prowess but also in his unwavering 
          devotion to his brother. Sasashi, despite lacking Grim's size and brawn, possessed a remarkable 
          agility and quick thinking that complemented his brother's power. Together, they formed an 
          unbreakable bond, relying on each other's strengths and supporting one another in their 
          shared pursuit of survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their reputation as a dynamic duo began to spread throughout the city's underworld. 
          They became known as "Grim and Sasashi, the Brothers of Desperation," drawing crowds 
          to witness their spectacular displays of skill and determination. With each victorious 
          battle, they earned a meager income, just enough to scrape by and keep hunger at bay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the gladiatorial arena, Grim and Sasashi harbored dreams of a better life. 
          The constant struggle had ignited a spark within them, a burning desire for something
           more than mere survival. They yearned to escape the oppressive shackles of poverty 
           and make a name for themselves outside the confines of the arena.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driven by this shared ambition, Grim and Sasashi tirelessly trained and honed 
          their combat skills. They sought to transcend their current circumstances and 
          use their prowess as gladiators to forge a new path. Through their tenacity 
          and determination, they aimed to secure a future where they could rise above 
          the slums and create a life of comfort and opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the path ahead remained uncertain and fraught with danger, Grim and Sasashi
          refused to succumb to despair. They would face each challenge with unwavering resolve,
          relying on their bond as brothers and their indomitable spirit to guide them through 
          the trials that awaited.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Grim and Sasashi stepped into the arena once again, they were not merely fighting 
          for survival. They fought for a chance to break free from the chains of poverty and leave 
          their mark on a world that had forgotten them. United in their pursuit of a better life, 
          the Brothers of Desperation stood tall, ready to face any opponent and seize the opportunities that lay ahead.
        </p>

          Doyle Hawke, a charismatic and agile half-elf, had once served with distinction 
          as a member of the esteemed City Watch in Waterdeep. Admired for his quick 
          reflexes, expert swordplay, and silver tongue, he had earned a reputation 
          as a formidable swashbuckler within the city's ranks. However, his promising 
          career took an unexpected turn when a scandal emerged, tarnishing his name 
          and leading to his dismissal from the force.
      </p>
      <p>The details of the scandal that plagued Doyle remain shrouded in mystery. 
          Whether it was a false accusation or a momentary lapse in judgment, the 
          repercussions were swift and severe. Stripped of his badge and reputation, 
          Doyle found himself cast aside, his dreams of a long and prosperous career 
          in law enforcement shattered.
      </p>
      <p>
          Faced with an uncertain future and a need to redeem himself, Doyle caught 
          the attention of the Harpers, a secretive organization dedicated to preserving 
          balance and safeguarding the realms. Recognizing his exceptional skills and his 
          potential for redemption, they extended an invitation to join their ranks.
      </p>
      <p>
          Embracing this chance for a fresh start, Doyle eagerly accepted the Harpers' offer. 
          The organization provided him with a new purpose, a chance to channel his talents 
          towards a noble cause. His first mission as a Harper was to assist a senior member 
          in investigating a series of unusual happenings around the town of Greenest.
